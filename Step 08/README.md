# Prompt 8

_The mirroring app has one more minor problem. The problem occurs when I lift my mouse (don't press the mouse button, that is I am not drawing). It connects the last point from the previous drawing with the first point of the new line that I'm drawing. It connects them with a straight line. Can you help me by not drawing a line between these points?_
