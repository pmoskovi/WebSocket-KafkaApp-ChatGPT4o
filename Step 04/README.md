# Prompt 4

_The Mirror HTML5 application doesn't draw. On the console it displays the following error message: 

Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'o', "[object Blob]" is not valid JSON at JSON.parse (<anonymous>) at ws.onmessage (indexConsumer.html:30:33) 

Before this error message, it shows:
Received from server: Blob

Can you try to fix this?_
